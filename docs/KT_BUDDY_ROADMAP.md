# KT Buddy Roadmap: Achieving Claude-Level Repository Understanding

## Vision
Build an AI system that understands repositories as deeply as Claude does - able to explain, document, diagram, critique, and guide developers through any codebase.

## Critical Gaps & Implementation Plan

### 1. 🧠 Deep Code Understanding (Priority: CRITICAL)

**Gap**: Current system does basic text matching. Claude understands semantics, patterns, and intent.

**Implementation Needed**:
```python
# src/agents/code_understander.py
class CodeUnderstander:
    def analyze_function_purpose(func_chunk) -> FunctionAnalysis:
        """Understand what a function DOES, not just its text"""
        # - Analyze control flow
        # - Track data transformations  
        # - Identify patterns (CRUD, validation, mapping, etc.)
        # - Detect side effects
        
    def trace_execution_path(entry_point) -> ExecutionFlow:
        """Follow code execution like a debugger"""
        # - Build call graphs
        # - Track data flow between functions
        # - Identify conditional branches
        
    def understand_architecture_patterns() -> ArchitectureInsights:
        """Recognize MVC, microservices, layered, etc."""
        # - Detect framework patterns
        # - Identify architectural boundaries
        # - Map data flow between layers
```

### 2. 📊 Intelligent Diagram Generation (Priority: HIGH)

**Gap**: Current diagrams are basic structure. Need semantic diagrams.

**Implementation Needed**:
```python
# src/tools/diagram_generator.py
class SmartDiagramGenerator:
    def sequence_diagram_from_code(entry_point: str) -> str:
        """Generate sequence diagrams by tracing execution"""
        # - Parse function calls
        # - Track async/await patterns
        # - Show actual data flow
        # Example output: PlantUML/Mermaid sequence diagram
        
    def system_architecture_diagram() -> str:
        """Generate C4 model diagrams"""
        # - Context diagram (external systems)
        # - Container diagram (apps/databases)
        # - Component diagram (modules)
        
    def data_flow_diagram(feature: str) -> str:
        """Show how data moves through the system"""
        # - Input sources
        # - Transformations
        # - Storage points
        # - Output destinations
        
    def class_diagram_smart() -> str:
        """UML with only important relationships"""
        # - Filter noise
        # - Show key inheritance/composition
        # - Include important methods only
```

### 3. 📝 Intelligent Documentation Generation (Priority: HIGH)

**Gap**: No automated documentation that actually explains the "why" and "how".

**Implementation Needed**:
```python
# src/agents/doc_generator.py

        # - Project purpose (inferred from code)
        # - Architecture overview
        # - Setup instructions (from config files)
        # - API documentation (from routes)
        # - Development workflow (from scripts)
        
    def generate_api_docs() -> str:
        """OpenAPI/Swagger from code analysis"""
        # - Extract routes
        # - Infer request/response schemas
        # - Document authentication
        # - Include examples

        """Figure out how to run the app"""
        # Parse: package.json scripts, Makefile, docker-compose
        # Detect: required services (DB, Redis, etc.)
        # Check: environment variables needed
        # Identify: build steps
        
    def detect_deployment_method() -> DeploymentGuide:
        """How is this deployed?"""
        # Check for: Dockerfile, k8s configs, CI/CD files
        # Identify: cloud provider configs (AWS, GCP, Azure)
        # Extract: deployment scripts
        
    def identify_dependencies() -> DependencyTree:

}
```

### Enhanced Retrieval
```python
# Multi-strategy retrieval
class HybridPlusRetriever:
    def search(query, strategy="auto"):
        if strategy == "auto":
            strategy = detect_query_type(query)
        
        if strategy == "execution_path":
            return trace_based_retrieval(query)
        elif strategy == "architectural":
            return component_based_retrieval(query)
        elif strategy == "semantic":
            return embedding_search(query)
        elif strategy == "lexical":
            return bm25_search(query)
```

### Context Window Management
```python
class ContextOptimizer:
    def build_optimal_context(query: str, max_tokens: int) -> str:
        """Build the most relevant context for the query"""
        # - Prioritize by relevance
        # - Include necessary dependencies
        # - Add framework context
        # - Keep under token limit
```

## Success Metrics

1. **Understanding Depth**: Can explain not just WHAT but WHY and HOW
2. **Diagram Quality**: Generates diagrams developers actually use
3. **Documentation Accuracy**: READMEs that match reality
4. **Setup Success Rate**: New developers can run the app first try
5. **Question Coverage**: Can answer 90%+ of typical developer questions

## Next Immediate Steps

1. **Start with Code Understanding**: Build `analyze_function_purpose()`
2. **Add Execution Analysis**: Build `detect_run_instructions()`
3. **Enhance Q&A**: Implement reasoning chains
4. **Test on Diverse Codebases**: React, Python, Java, Go, etc.

This roadmap will transform ADAM into a true KT buddy that understands code like Claude does!
